# Moriant stock system.

This will eventually morph into a re-shape-able stock system,
where it will be like a stock management admin system.

This is built with a long-term development in mind,
and is not finished yet, just the fundamentals.

! important: For the interview, only the stores folder
and templates / stores is relevant. The user system uses
a prototype build which has not been properly implemented.

Requirements:
- Django
- Mysqlclient
- Json-parser
- Requests
